# AI-College-Helper
AI College Help is a mobile application, currently published on the Play Store, designed to help students learn faster and smarter. The app allows users to upload PDFs or capture images of study material, and it instantly generates summaries, key points, quizzes, and instant solutions using AI.
I collaborated with Yogesh Vashisht on this project as a full-stack developer, focusing on making the application more scalable and highly efficient.
